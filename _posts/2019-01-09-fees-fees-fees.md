The 2019 [Sandblast Rally](https://www.sandblastrally.com/) has an entry fee that varies based on what type of vehicle you are competing in and when you register. Since I am a first-time competitor, I was eligible for _early entry_, which began in late December. For motorcycles, the early entry fee was $290. Notably, this is an increase of $30 from last year.

But that's not all. Since Sandblast is part of the [NASA Rally Sport (NRS)](http://nasarallysport.com/main/) [Atlantic Rally Cup](http://nasarallysport.com/main/Atlantic-Rally-Cup), I need to become a member of NRS---not to be confused with the [spacegoing NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)---and also obtain a NASA rally license. In order to become a member of NRS, I just had to part with $45 for a 1-year membership; easy-peasy.

To get a NASA rally license, there's an extra step. In addition to the $65 rally license fee, I also had to get the [medical form](http://nasarallysport.com/main/rally202) completed by my doctor and sent over to NRS. This isn't anything crazy, just a quick once-over and sign-off that you're shipshape and safe to race. No one wants you to have a seizure or heart attack while you're on the course.

So that's $400 in fees just to get in the door.
