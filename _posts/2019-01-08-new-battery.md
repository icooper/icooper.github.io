After [the incident bringing the bike home from the storage unit]({% link _posts/2019-01-03-bringing-it-home.md %}), it was clear that a new battery was needed. I ended up ordering a WPS Featherweight lithium battery while I was waiting around in the parking lot for roadside assistance to come and give me a jump. It arrived today! *Hurray!*

The current battery in [the KTM](https://ian.does.racing/the-vehicle) is an old lithium battery by Sycl (no longer in business) that has been in the bike for *at least* five years. It might be salvageable but I feel like it's worth the relatively low cost to replace it, especially since

* the KTM 505 XC-F has no kickstarter and
* the Rekluse auto-clutch means that push-starting it requires some tools.

I *really* want the magic button to work reliably.

I chose the WPS battery because it was an affordable, lightweight, and of course won't spill <s>when I dump the bike</s> if the bike needs a nap. It has an integrated battery capacity indicator on top that gives you a low/medium/high indication by way of some LEDs at the press of a button. I know that it's more a gimmick than anything else, but it is cool.

The new battery slipped right in and the cables attached to the terminals without any interference; there's good power to the lights and fan now. It's a bit late tonight to fire it up---the neighbors have little kids that I don't want to wake up---but I'll take it out for a spin (probably to the car wash) tomorrow.
