[It's long overdue]({% link _posts/2019-01-15-graphics-part-1.md %}), but I was busy with other things recently. Last night I finally finished the vinyl on the fairing! I zipped home from work at lunch today to pull the bike out into the daylight for a few photos.

I love how it all came out. There were a few points in time where I was a little skeptical about how it was going, but in the end the effort was totally worth it. I'm neither an artist nor a professional wrapper, but I'm thrilled with the result.

Of course, now there's a huge pile of scraps still on my kitchen table that I should probably clean up soon.
