title: Removing Facebook Tracking Params
date: 2018-10-22
---

Facebook recently began adding a `fbclid` parameter to external links. Using the Firefox add-on [Neat URL](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/neat-url/), you can easily remove these and other similar tracking parameters.

  1. Install [Neat URL](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/neat-url/).
  2. Go to the add-on preferences by right-clicking on the `?_` icon and selecting _Preferences_.
  3. Scroll down a bit to the _Blocked parameters_ box. It should already be prepopulated with a lot of parameters. At the time of this writing, `fbclid` is not in there by default, but I won't be surprised when the author adds it.
  4. If it's not in there already, add `fbclid` to the list. I added it in the middle with the other `fb_*` parameters.
  5. Make sure you hit the _Save preferences_ button at the bottom of the page.

Once you've completed the above steps, you can test by going to [`https://ianc.blog/?fbclid=foo`](https://ianc.blog/?fbclid=foo). The extension modifies the request before it is sent to the server, so you should see the address bar show `https://ianc.blog/` right away.

You're all set!
