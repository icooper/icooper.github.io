Obviously it's generally a good idea to carry a first aid kit when you're out riding. In this case, a first aid kit is specifically required by [the rules](http://nasarallysport.com/rules-forms/NASA-Rally-Sport-General-Regulations-for-Rallies-Section-4.pdf). It states that at a minimum, the first aid kit should consist of:

* Gauze pads or rolls
* Adhesive tape
* Elastic bandage (like an Ace bandage)
* Safety pins or clips for the elastic bandage
* Scissors or knife
* Emergency blanket
* First aid manual

It's basically impossible to find an off-the-shelf first aid kit with just those items, so I purchased an inexpensive but relatively comprehensive home first aid kit. I pulled the required items out of the kit, along with a few more things:

* Nitrile gloves (2 pairs)
* Alcohol-free sterile wipes
* CPR face mask
* Instant cold compress
* Gauze trauma pad (5x9-inch)

I've taken everything and packed it into a gallon-sized ziplock bag. Note that the scissors are quite sharp however they have blunt ends so I don't think they'll inadvertently puncture the bag or anything in it. This bag will go, along with a folding FMVSS #125 warning triangle and the required OK/help placard, into a small bag mounted on the back of the bike or into my hydration pack. I haven't figured out storage yet, but according to the rules, it can be either mounted to the bike or mounted to me---either is acceptable as long as it is easily accessible.

Generally I like to minimize what I'm carrying on my back, but I need to assess how things could mount to or fit on the bike---it might just make more sense to throw everything into my hydration pack. I'll write a post later on how I'm carrying the required equipment once I sort everything out.

It's important to be prepared, but here's hoping that I won't have to use anything in the first aid kit on myself or anyone else!

## Update

After talking to one of my friends who is a medical professional, I upgraded the scissors to a proper pair of [trauma shears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_shears). They're inexpensive and far more versatile than the super basic scissors that were included with the home first aid kit. I also added an [Israeli bandadge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Bandage) and [SAM Splint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_Splint). The whole kit is a little more bulky now, but still not much heavier.
