I'm heading down to South Carolina today to attend the rally racing clinic and then the [Sandblast Rally](https://www.sandblastrally.com/) itself. I am not bringing a computer with me, so I probably will not add any more posts until I get back.

In the meantime, follow my [Facebook page](https://fb.me/iandoesracing) and [Instagram feed](https://instagram.com/iandoesracing) to stay up to date on how things are going.
