I'm officially a 2019 Sandblast Rally finisher! As racer #134, I placed 10<sup>th</sup> out of 17 in my class (MM), and 22<sup>nd</sup> out of 41 bikes overall. [Here are the official results from NASA Rally Sport.](http://www.nasarallysport.com/results/2019-Sandblast-Rally-index.htm) I wasn't wicked fast, but I didn't hurt myself or the bike, and I had a lot of fun in the process.

Now it's time for a nap.
