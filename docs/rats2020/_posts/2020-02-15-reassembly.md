  Unlike Humpty Dumpty, it's put back together.

[Yesterday]({% post_url /rats2020/2020-02-14-powder-coating %}), I got the frame back from the powder coating shop and I began reassembly by installing a new headset. Today, I reassembled the rest of the bike. Most of these components were already on the bike before powder-coating, so it all went back together without any trouble.

I've ridden the bike a lot with most of these components, but the handlebars and pedals are newâ€”tomorrow afternoon I've got a ride in mind to see how everything feels.
