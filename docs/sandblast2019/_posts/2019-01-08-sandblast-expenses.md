<p class="lead">Motorcycle racing isn't cheap.</p>

In the interest of full transparency, here's a tally of my costs involved. I've grouped the expenses into several categories:
* __Entry__: entry and administrative fees
* __Racer__: things for me
* __Vehicle__: things for the bike
* __Cosmetic__: things related to making the bike look good
* __Travel__: things related to getting to and from the event

Keep in mind, as I have been riding for years, I already have a lot of motorcycle gear. Don't consider this an exhaustive list of what's needed to participate in an event like thisâ€”notably, I also did not include any food costs. Most items in the list are linked to a relevant blog post.

Although the entry fee for Sandblast is relatively low, that's only a small part of the expense of participating in an event like this. Many thanks to my coworker and friend Andrew for his support in getting me to the 2019 Sandblast Rally.
