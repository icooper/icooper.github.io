<p class="lead" markdown="1">The rally bike is sold!</p>

You can read a little bit about the [history of the bike over here]({% post_url /sandblast2019/2018-12-31-the-ktm %}). Right now, it's set up like I had it at the 2019 Sandblast Rally.

I've owned this bike since 2014. I raced it in the [2019 Sandblast Rally](https://www.sandblastrally.com/) ([bike prep details](/the-vehicle#2019-sandblast-rally-bike-prep)) at the beginning of March and it ran flawlessly. Before that, I mostly just used it to putt around on trails and do some light dual-sporting. Although it has served me reliably, it is really built to be a desert rally racer and isn't at home as a dual-sport or trail bike. I am more of a slow trail rider so I think it's time for the 505 to move on to a new home.

The bike has a license plate and is street-legal with a normal Kentucky street title in my name.

**The rally bike has been sold; thanks to everyone who was interested.**
