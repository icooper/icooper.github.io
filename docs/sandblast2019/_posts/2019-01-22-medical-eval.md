title: Medical Evaluation
---

In order to get a NASA rally license, [you have to see a doctor](http://nasarallysport.com/main/rally202) and fill out a [medical evaluation form](http://nasarallysport.com/rules-forms/NRS_Form_Medical.pdf). The doctor will check your usual vitals, test your peripheral vision and neurological function, and make a determination as to whether or not you are fit to receive a rally license. Since this is directly related to getting the rally license, I included it on the [expenses list]({% post_url /sandblast2019/2019-01-08-sandblast-expenses %}) in the _Entry_ category.

Keep in mind that health insurance doesn't cover things like this. If you are due for an annual physical, your doctor may be able to complete this as part of the physical since basically everything in here should be something they're already doing.

The main goal of the evaluation is to make sure that you don't have any underlying condition that might preclude competitive motorsports. If you have a history of seizures or blackouts or a trick heart, then you probably shouldn't be racing and your doctor will tell you that. So don't stress out about it if you're out of shape (like me) but otherwise generally healthyâ€”you're in good company.

I already had my annual physical recently, so I went down to the local walk-in clinic for this since I was going to be paying out of pocket. The evaluation itself took about 20 minutes (after about a 30 minute wait) since I had already filled out my medical history on the form before meeting the doctor.

Once you have the form completed, you can [scan, fax, or mail it to NASA Rally Sport](http://nasarallysport.com/main/where_do_i_send_the_medical_form). Depending on your age, you may not have to deal with it again for a few years.
